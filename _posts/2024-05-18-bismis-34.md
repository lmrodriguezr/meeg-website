Recent developments in the prokaryotic nomenclature have led the ICSP to propose
integrating *Candidatus* names into the ICNP, aiming to formally regulate names
of uncultured prokaryotes.
While this is a significant step forward by the ICSP, members of the SeqCode
committee, including Prof. William Whitman, Ass. Prof. Luis M. Rodriguez-R, and
Dr. Maria Chuvochina, have expressed concerns.
During the recent BISMiS Live session, they discussed why this proposal might
not be "the best of both worlds" solution, highlighting potential drawbacks and
issues. 
We encourage everyone to listen to this discussion (see the link below) and to
carefully consider the consequences of this new proposal, which will be voted on
in July.
