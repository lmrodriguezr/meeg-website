## Description
The content of the thesis will be in the field of molecular ecology and
bioinformatics. The start of the work would be planned for the Winter semester
2023. Thematically, the Master's thesis deals with the detailed taxonomic and
functional characterization of a genomic catalogue derived from metagenomic
datasets from a biogas fermenter community. Integration of data and close
collaboration with a proteomics research group in KÃ¶then/Magdeburg
(Saxony-Anhalt, Germany) is anticipated.

## Prerequisites
A current Master's degree in microbiology, an independent way of working and
interest in the topic. Bioinformatics and High-Performance Computing techniques
will be applied in the course of this thesis, but no previous experience is
required.
