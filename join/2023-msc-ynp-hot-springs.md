**=== THIS CALL IS NOW CLOSED ===**

|--------------|----------------------------------------
| **Title**    | USA Yellowstone National Park Hot Springs Metagenomics
| **Advisor**  | Dr. Luis M. Rodriguez-R, Department of Microbiology and Digital Science Center (DiSC)
| **Number of students** | 2
| **Language** | English

## Description
The selected students will process the metagenomic data obtained from several
hot springs in the USA Yellowstone National Park in collaboration with Dr.
Zoe Pratte of Montana State University. The successful applicants will learn
basic metagenomic techniques for the processing of short- and long-read data,
as well as advanced bioinfomatic methods for the determination of prokaryotic
genomes from metagenomes (genome-resolved metagenomics), graphical pangenomics
representation and processing, and microdiversity quantification. The main aims
of this project are the determination of genomic adaptations of thermophilic
prokaryotes and the development and application of techniques for the
quantification of environmental and biogreographic ranges of specific
populations.

## Prerequisites
Ongoing Master's degree in microbiology, a capacity for both independent and
team work, and interest in both molecular biology and microbial ecology.

## Theoretical skills
Foundations on microbiology and molecular biology are highly desirable.
Additionally, knowledge on distributed systems and High-Performance Computing is
appreciated but not required. Interest in environmental genomics is required,
but no previous knowledge necessary.

## Practical skills
HPC scheduler systems and basic knowledge on Bash is preferred, but not
required.

## Additional information
The student will remotely interact with the Co-PI Dr. Zoe Pratte (Montana State
University, USA) at least once, and a presentation of their results is highly
encouraged.
