| **Title**    | Genomic Characterization of Novel Bacteria with Plastic Degradation Potential
| **Advisor**  | Assist. Prof. Dr. Luis Miguel Rodriguez Rojas, Department of Microbiology and Digital Science Center (DiSC)
| **Number of students** | 1
| **Language** | English

## Description
Bioprospection of microbial aggregates is a promising avenue for the reduction
of the global environmental impact of plastics. Two of the most important
metabolic processes to achieve this aim are microbial plastic degradation and
synthesis of bioplastics. The laboratory of Dr. Diego Jim√©nez (Universidad de
Los Andes, Colombia) has sampled lignocellulose-rich mangrove soils heavily
impacted by plastics contamination, and selected a consortium with reduced
diversity by successive transfers in minimum media only amended with PET as
their carbon source. A collection of high-quality genomes from this consortium
was obtained by long-read metagenomic sequencing. The successful candidate will
lead the efforts on characterizing these genomes with an emphasis on their
taxonomic description and metabolic annotation. The latter will focus on the
identification of enzymes and metabolic pathways potentially associated to
plastic degradation and/or bioplastic synthesis.

## Tasks

- Training on environmental genomics fundamental concepts and basic
  computational techniques
- Training on the use of High-Performance Computing (HPC) to access the services
  of the LEO clusters
- Taxonomic description of the microorganisms presented here following the
  guidelines of the SeqCode (Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes Described
  from Sequence Data)
- Functional annotation of genes associated to plastic-degradation in the
  genome collection
- Targeted metabolic reconstruction for pathways relevant to plastic degradation
  and/or bioplastic synthesis
- Presentation of results orally and in a written report

## Theoretical skills
Foundations on microbiology and molecular biology are highly desirable.
Additionally, knowledge on distributed systems and High-Performance Computing is
appreciated but not required. Interest in environmental genomics is required,
but no previous knowledge necessary.

## Practical skills
HPC Scheduler Systems and Basic knowledge on Bash is preferred, but not
required.

## Additional information
The student will remotely interact with the Jimenez Laboratory at the
Universidad de Los Andes (Colombia) at least once, and a presentation of their
results is highly encouraged.
