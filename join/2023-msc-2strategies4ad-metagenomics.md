| **Title**    | 2Strategies4AD: Metagenomics/Metaproteomics
| **Advisor**  | Dr. Sebastian Hupfauf, Department of Microbiology
| **Co-Advisor** | Assist. Prof. Dr. Luis Miguel Rodriguez Rojas, Department of Microbiology and Digital Science Center (DiSC)
| **Number of students** | 1
| **Language** | English

## Description
The content of the thesis will be in the field of molecular ecology and
bioinformatics. The start of the work would be planned for **mid-January**,
although a start in **early February** would also be possible if desired.
In the course of the Master's thesis, an
**8-week stay abroad in KÃ¶then/Magdeburg (Saxony-Anhalt, Germany)** is also
planned. Thematically, the Master's thesis deals with the molecular biological
and bioinformatic analysis of samples from biogas fermenters. The samples will
be analysed both at the protein level (**metaproteomics**) and at the DNA level
(**metagenomics**).

## Prerequisites
A current Master's degree in microbiology, an independent way of working and
interest in the topic.
